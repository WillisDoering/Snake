March 20:
   * Added base code to game and created .gitignore

March 21:
   * Researched possible ways to do pathfinding

March 26:
   * Named player "Nydus"
   * Started work on "Nydus" prototype
   * Imported graph class written previously
   * Started work on BFS class

March 28:
   * Worked on BFS class, creating heatmap
   * Adapted Graph to use #defines from playfield.h
   * Modified Makefile to compile new files
   * Included graph and BFS calls in player.cpp

April 03:
   * Renamed BFS class to Heatmap
   * Finished construction of heatmap
   * Created findFood function for the Heatmap class
   * Condensed findFood and findHead into find item for flexibility

April 04:
   * Added debugging flags to the makefile
   * Worked on path generation an found a problem with heatmap

April 09:
   * Fixed problem related to heatmap generation and graph generation
   * Looked back at old code from the tank platform for pathfinding
   * Worked on path generation bug

April 10:
   * Updated to new version of the platform
   * Fixed bug in Heatmap where I was passing in heat instead of position
   * Fixed bug in Heatmap where directions were inverted
   * Fixed bug in Heatmap where the path finding traversal went out of scope
   * Pushed 1st functional implementation

April 15:
   * Created scanner for maps without obstacles. Works perfect for even height and best less width for odd

April 17:
   * Merged finished No Obstacles implementation with master
   * Began design on scanner like implementation for obstacle maps
   * Made it so when the snake can't find a path, it keeps on going forward until it finds one or dies

April 19:
   * Continued design on scanner implementation
   * Updated Doxygen and broke up large functions

April 20:
   * Started design on a different method used ot coil snake after each food piece

April 21:
   * Continued work on coil design
   * Abandoned coil due to time restrictions
   * Fixed some names and documentation
   * Found a bug related to the graph adjacency list
