Code Review and comments:

   - Kind of a cop-out for the no obstacle version.  Also, huge difference in performance
     between the obstacle and no obstacle versions.

   - Good job on the comments and modularity.

   - Not convinced that 'heatmap' is the right name for the grid you create.  How does that
     constitute the heat of anything?  Looks and works a lot like BFS.
